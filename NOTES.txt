Need to update in template in dist/ before upload to allow uploading of images through CloudFront:

ImageHandlerDistribution:
    Type: 'AWS::CloudFront::Distribution'
    Properties:
      DistributionConfig:
        …
        DefaultCacheBehavior:
          AllowedMethods:
            - GET
            - HEAD
             - PUT
             - POST
             - PATCH
             - OPTIONS
             - DELETE

Thumbor does not save images by default when using S3
For named images, need to enable uploading. Can name image via ‘Slug’ header
	Hashed url path is returned in response header, ‘Location’ (can prepend CloudFront host to get this image)
